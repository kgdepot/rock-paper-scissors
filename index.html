<!-- 

In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on 
buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener 
to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct 
playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs 
into DOM methods.
Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once 
one player reaches 5 points.
